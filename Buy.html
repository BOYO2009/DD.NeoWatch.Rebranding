            end in 1991 after he revealed he was HIV-positive. Even so, Magic
            still left with the <strong>second-most triple-doubles</strong> in

            A sharp-shooting forward who spent his entire career with the
            Celtics, <strong>Hall of Famer</strong> Larry Bird played on three
            NBA championship-winning teams during his brilliant run in Boston. A
            <strong>three-time MVP</strong> and
            <strong>12-time All-Star</strong>, Bird is the charter member of the
            50-40-90 club, a seven-man crew of stars who managed to post
            season-long shooting percentages of at least <strong>50%</strong> on
            field goals, <strong>40%</strong> on 3-pointers, and
            <strong>90%</strong> on free throws.
            <br />
            Bird's all-around game and clutch shooting
            <strong>redefined</strong> the small forward position and turned the
            Celtics back into winners. Bird's
            <strong>mastery of fundamentals</strong> and competitive spirit
            rejuvenated both the NBA and the Celtics, alongside fellow rookie
            and Los Angeles Lakers player Magic Johnson. When Bird retired in
            1992, he held <strong>27 Celtics records</strong> and brought
            <strong>three more championship</strong> banners to Boston (1981,
            1984, 1986).

            Kobe Bryant was a ruthless scorer who always seemed able to squeeze
            off a shot, no matter how tough it looked. A
            <strong>five-time NBA champion</strong>, Bryant retired as the
            <strong>third-leading scorer</strong> in league history, trailing
            only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone.
            <br />
            Kobe's model of <strong>excellence</strong> was also reflected in
            everything he touched, and that applies to the Lakers and the NBA as
            a whole. Even in retirement, Kobe Bryant's name meant
            <strong>hard work</strong> and <strong>inspiration</strong> to many
            people. That became part of American culture.
